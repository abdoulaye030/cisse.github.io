excerpt: 'As food systems in developing countries transition from serving hyper-localized populations to serving consumers in urban centers nationally and abroad, both more and less complex value chain pathways often exist simultaneously. These pathways, which we define as unique sequences of actor types that transfer goods from producers to final consumers, may differ widely in their participants and functionalities. Hence policies aimed at upgrading “value chains” in general may miss important interactions and heterogeneity between pathways. In this paper, we suggest a framework for characterizing value chains as systems of unique pathways, which could be used for prioritization of value chain interventions. Specifically, we apply this framework to study the onion value chain in Senegal, characterizing the differences in inclusiveness, flexibility, quality recognition, and competitiveness between pathways.'
